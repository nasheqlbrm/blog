    "# Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume without loss of generality that the objective function coefficients $c_{j}$ of all decision variables, $x_{j}$, in Problem 1.7 are non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that Problem 1.5 defines $n$ sub-problems, one for each decision variable $x_k$ in Problem 1.7. Now, suppose there is no subscript $k$ for which the sub-problems are unbounded. This means we can identify constants $M_{1},\\ldots,M_{n}$ which are the maximum objective function values for each sub-problem in Problem 1.5. So, for example, $M_1$ is the largest value $x_{1}$ can take while still staying feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let $I_{c_{j} \\gt 0}$ be an indicator function that tells us with a one or a zero whether the coefficient of decision variable $x_{j}$ in the objective function of Problem 1.7 is strictly positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we claim that $M=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_{j}I_{c_{j} \\gt 0}M_{j}$ is the greatest upper bound on the objective function of Problem 1.7. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that if some objective function coefficient $c_{l}$ is negative that a more accurate upper bound can be obtained by solving a minimization version of Problem 1.5. Solving this minimization would give us the smallest $x_{l}$ for which the problem remains feasible. But since $c_{l} \\lt 0$ having $x_{l} >0$ will only serve to reduce $\\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_{j}x_{j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that $M$ is the greatest upper bound on the objective function of Problem 1.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the existence of a finite upper bound contradicts the unboundedness of Problem 1.7 since for an unbounded problem we can always find a feasible solution such that $\\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_{j}x_{j} \\gt M$ for any value of $M$."
